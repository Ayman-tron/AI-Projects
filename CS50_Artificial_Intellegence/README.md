# Predicting User Purchasing Intent using Nearest-Neighbor Classifier

In this project, I developed a nearest-neighbor classifier to predict a user's purchasing intent on an online shopping website using machine learning. The classifier utilizes features such as:
- Number of pages visited
- Shopping on weekends
- Web browser used

To make predictions, the model was trained and evaluated using a dataset of 12,000 user sessions. I measured accuracy using sensitivity and specificity metrics and achieved a high level of accuracy in determining user's purchase intent with a reasonable balance between sensitivity and specificity.
